üîç Risk Assessment Categories
Security Protocols
WEP - Extremely High Risk (deprecated encryption)
WPA - High Risk (vulnerable to attacks)
WPA2 - Medium Risk (depends on configuration)
WPA3 - Low Risk (latest security standard)
Open Networks - Critical Risk (no encryption)
Signal Strength Analysis
Strong signals indicate proximity and potential accessibility
Weak signals may suggest distance or interference
Signal pattern analysis for rogue access point detection
Network Configuration Assessment
Default credentials detection
Vendor-specific vulnerability analysis
Broadcast settings evaluation
Channel congestion analysis
üìà Risk Scoring System
WRA uses a comprehensive scoring algorithm that considers:

Encryption Strength (40% weight)
Authentication Methods (25% weight)
Signal Strength & Proximity (15% weight)
Network Configuration (10% weight)
Known Vulnerabilities (10% weight)
Risk Levels:

0-25: Low Risk (Green)
26-50: Medium Risk (Yellow)
51-75: High Risk (Orange)
76-100: Critical Risk (Red)
üìÑ Report Generation
